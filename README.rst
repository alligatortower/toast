# ABANDONED
============

This is old and obviously abandoned. It was a game Trevor Mormon and I were designing. We both lost interest. If it's ever revived we'd almost certainly start from scratch. The code is not worth saving.

# FUTURE
==========
That said. Sometimes I think about it. The premise is still valid I think. Here are some ideas I'm writing down so I can get them out of my head so I can go work on other things.

At least 4 or 5 player I think.

one is the king
one is the assassin

there are some assortment of drink types, maybe based on player count

each player has a subset of drinks they cannot drink. and one drink type that is their favorite. These subsets are public knowledge.

the exceptions:

* the king who can drink anything.
* the assassin cannot win no matter how many of their favorite drinks they drink.

the assassin can poison a drink once per round.
normal people feel fine until their third dose of poison
the king is frail and dies after the second

Win conditions
* king: wins after X toasts (player count based?). drinking his favorite drink makes the toast count for 2.
* assassin: wins if the king dies. However, if they drink their favorite drink three times they blow their cover and lose
* other: drink your favorite drink 3 times

multiple people can win, but if at least one person wins the game is over after that round
